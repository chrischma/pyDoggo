# About

pyDoggo is a telegram-bot.
the script automatically takes messages stored in `/greetings` and sends them via Telegram on certain daytime. 
pyDoggo reminds us to go for a walk and always keep the food bowl filled. 

although this is just for fun, feel free to adapt the code for your cat, pig or lizard.
